# The home_view function is a view that takes a request object and returns a response object. In this case, the response object is a rendered template called index.html.
# The render function takes the request object, the template name, and an optional context dictionary as arguments, and returns an HttpResponse object with the rendered template.
# The index.html template is located in the templates directory of the main app. It is a simple HTML file that displays a welcome message.
# The urlpatterns list in the ebdjango/urls.py file includes a path to the home_view function, which is the main view for the application. When a user visits the root URL of the site, the home_view function is called, and the index.html template is rendered and displayed to the user.
# The home_view function is a simple view that renders the index.html template. In a more complex application, views can perform various tasks such as processing form data, interacting with the database, and returning different responses based on the request.
# The render function is a shortcut provided by Django to simplify the process of rendering templates. It takes care of loading the template, rendering it with the provided context data, and returning an HttpResponse object with the rendered content.
# The index.html template is a simple HTML file that contains a welcome message. It is located in the templates directory of the main app, which is the default location for Django templates. Templates can include variables, loops, conditionals, and other template tags to generate dynamic content based on the context data provided by the view.
